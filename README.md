# SiRPG Introduction
SiRPG -the Simple RPG- is an experimental table top RPG, which focusses on ease of use and applicability to many different game setting.
It consists of different modules which can be used independently of each other and may be integrated into other games as well.

# Moule 1: The Character Sheet

A character has different **attributes** and **professions**, which are summarized in the character sheet.
Each entry in the character sheet is quantified by a number.

A character has four **attributes**:

- **Fitness** describes how strong, fast and enduring a character is.
- **Agility** describes the fine motoric skills and dexterity of the character.
- **Intelligence** describes the intelligence and knowledge of a character.
- **Charisma** describes the empathic skills and the overall charisma of a character.

Next, a character has one ore more **professions** which the player can choose freely.
Professions can be viewed as classes, like *detective* or *battlefield medic*.
Note that there are no scores for individual skills, but each professions implcitly covers a whole set of skills.

Be as precise as possible when describing your **profession** and maybe add a sentence to describe what you actually mean.
A generic *warrior* which provieds no further explanation leaves it unlear if this person can use a sword or a laser gun,
if he has any experience commanding troops or organizing logisitics.
Making your character instead a *sword master* who fights in battles and teaches the young nobility how to be knights clears up what the character can do.

## Character Creation

Initially, a player assignes the numbers -1, 0, 1, 2 to his **attributes** as he or she wishes.
The player then chooses one **profession** and gives it a score of two.

The character's initial **hitpoints** are then set as 10 plus the fitness score.

## Leveling up

When the players accieved an important milestone in the story, they can level up their characters.
Each player can improve one of his his attribute or profession scores by one.
If he choses to improve his fitness score, also his hitpoints are increased by one.
Then each player rolls 1D6 and adds that result to their hitpoints.

New professions can be aquired at any time.
For this, just write down the profession you are interested in learning and give it an intitial value of zero.
You can now start to use it, intially without benefit for the action but with the possibility to learn by leveling up.

## Using Skills

To determine the success of an in game action, the player rolls a D20 and adds the score of his most relevant attribute and of the highest applicable profession.
If no profession is applicable, add zero.
Every skill check has to make a reasonable assumption whether a profession applies to the situation.
The result has then to be greater or equal a given threshold for the action to succeed.
The threshold can be either fixed for a static obstacle or an opposing skill check for a competition against another character.

### Helping other Players

In some situations characters can help each other with their skill checks.
Those situations are usually calm enough to think things through and have some possibility for the characters to interact. 
In those situations one other player can describe how he would help the action of another.
The helping character then chooses which of his attribute or profession scores can be applied.
This score is then added to the skill checks result.

Note that only one help action can be added per skill check and that a battle typically is not a calm enough situation.

### Using Equipment and the Environment

Using equipment can help you accieve a task.
You can use one piece of equipment in an action, for example a magnifying glass to look for hidden clues.
In this case you can add a bonus to your skill check.
Equipment can have a value for the bonus assigned to them.
With weapons and shields this will typically be an attack or defense bonus.
If equipment has no value specified, the bonus is one.

In some cases, also the environment can help you in your skill check.
Darkness can help you hide, a corner can help you take cover from enemy fire.
Every benefitial environmental factor gives you one bonus.

### The Formula

1D20 + Attribute + Profession + Help + Equipment + Environment >= threshold
