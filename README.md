# SiRPG Introduction
SiRPG -the Simple RPG- is an experimental table top RPG, which focusses on ease of use and applicability to many different game setting.
It consists of different modules which can be used independently of each other and may be integrated into other games as well.

# Moule 1: The Character Sheet

A character has different **attributes** and **professions**, which are summarized in the character sheet.
Each entry in the character sheet is quantified by a number.

A character has four **attributes**:

- **Fitness** describes how strong, fast and enduring a character is.
- **Agility** describes the fine motoric skills and dexterity of the character.
- **Intelligence** describes the intelligence and knowledge of a character.
- **Charisma** describes the empathic skills and the overall charisma of a character.

Next, a character has one ore more **professions** which the player can choose freely.
Professions can be viewed as classes, like *detective* or *battlefield medic*.
Note that there are no scores for individual skills, but each professions implcitly covers a whole set of skills.

Be as precise as possible when describing your **profession** and maybe add a sentence to describe what you actually mean.
A generic *warrior* which provieds no further explanation leaves it unlear if this person can use a sword or a laser gun,
if he has any experience commanding troops or organizing logisitics.
Making your character instead a *sword master* who fights in battles and teaches the young nobility how to be knights clears up what the character can do.

## Character Creation

Initially, a player assignes the numbers -1, 0, 1, 2 to his **attributes** as he or she wishes.
The player then chooses one **profession** and gives it a score of two.

The character's initial **hitpoints** are then set as 10 plus the fitness score.

## Leveling up

When the players accieved an important milestone in the story, they can level up their characters.
Each player can improve one of his his attribute or profession scores by one.
If he choses to improve his fitness score, also his hitpoints are increased by one.
Then each player rolls 1D6 and adds that result to their hitpoints.

New professions can be aquired at any time.
For this, just write down the profession you are interested in learning and give it an intitial value of zero.
You can now start to use it, intially without benefit for the action but with the possibility to learn by leveling up.

## Using Skills

To determine the success of an in game action, the player rolls a D20 and adds the score of his most relevant attribute and of the highest applicable profession.
If no profession is applicable, add zero.
Every skill check has to make a reasonable assumption whether a profession applies to the situation.
The result has then to be greater or equal a given threshold for the action to succeed.
The threshold can be either fixed for a static obstacle or an opposing skill check for a competition against another character.

### Helping other Players

In some situations characters can help each other with their skill checks.
Those situations are usually calm enough to think things through and have some possibility for the characters to interact. 
In those situations one other player can describe how he would help the action of another.
The helping character then chooses which of his attribute or profession scores can be applied.
This score is then added to the skill checks result.

Note that only one help action can be added per skill check and that a battle typically is not a calm enough situation.

### Using Equipment and the Environment

Using equipment can help you accieve a task.
You can use one piece of equipment in an action, for example a magnifying glass to look for hidden clues.
In this case you can add a bonus to your skill check.
Equipment can have a value for the bonus assigned to them.
With weapons and shields this will typically be an attack or defense bonus.
If equipment has no value specified, the bonus is one.

In some cases, also the environment can help you in your skill check.
Darkness can help you hide, a corner can help you take cover from enemy fire.
Every benefitial environmental factor gives you one bonus.

### The Formula

1D20 + Attribute + Profession + Help + Equipment + Environment >= threshold

# Module 2: Special Abilities

Special abilities represent a way to play with magic or great skills.
A character can receive special abilities to increase it's uniqueness and improve an interesting play style.
A player can invent new special abilities, and choose one during character creation.
They too are noted in the players character sheet.
Some abilities can level up to grant more bonuses, so instead of investing level points into attributes and professions, they can be invested into those abilities.

## Example Abilities

### Civilian Abilities

**Speechcraft Expert**
 - applies to skill checks in the context of talking
 - e.g. persuading, charming or tricking someone, negotiating for better prices, ...
 - once per scene you can reroll a failed skill check

**Dodge Master**
 - instead of using your armour class to determine if an attack hits you, you can choose to roll a skill check to dodge
 - your "armour class" for that incoming hit is a skill check using the agility attribute and any plausible profession, e.g. boxer or ninja
 - for ease of use, instead of rolling each time the armour class can be fixed by using 10 as the fixed income of the dice roll

# Module 3: Weapons and Armour

## Weapons
Weapons can be categorized into five tiers:

 - **Tier 0** bare hands
 - **Tier 1** improvized weapons: sticks, stones, bottles
 - **Tier 2** small weapons: knives, slingshots, throwing stars. They can be build quickly out of simple materials.
 - **Tier 3** one handed weapons: rapiers, pistols, axes
 - **Tier 4** two handed weapons: longswords, muskets, halbeards, longbows

Each tier gives a weapon that many points to distribute to the four weapon stats:
 - **Range** For meele weapons, allocating a point in range allows the weapon to attack even if somebody is in between the wielder and the target.
For ranged weapons, a point in range addes half of the base range to it.
 - **Attack** Added attack bonus. Allocate points here if the weapon is heavy or blunt or opposite of that easy to aim with
 - **Damage** Added damage bonus. Allocate points here if the weapon is sharp.
 - **Defense** Added armour class bonus. Allocate points here if the weapon is longer then half a meter,
 or made to block like a shield or a parrying dagger.

If a weapon is a special artifact, masterly crafted or magical, it gains one point which can be added to its stats.
If the weapon is rusty or cursed, you can subtract a point from its stats.

### Attacking with a Weapon

Attacking is a skill check.
A weapon which requires muscle force to deliver the attack uses the fitness attribute.
Breaking with role playing tradition, this definition also includes bows.
If the weapons attack instead triggers without the use of force, and the user can instead focus on aiming,
agility or intelligence can be used as relevant attributes.

The **attack** value of a given weapon is added as the equipment modifier to the above skill check formula.
If the attack succeeds, the damage is 1d6 + the **damage** attribute of the weapon.

### Example Weapons

| Name   | Tier | Attr | rng | atk | dmg | def |
|--------|------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Buckler | T2, meele | fitness | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 |
| Rapier | T3, meele | fitness | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| Parrying Dagger | T2, meele | fitness | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| Halbeard | T4, meele | fitness | 1 | 0/2* | 2/0* | 1 |
| Musket | T4, range | agility | 1 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
| Longbow | T4, range | fitness | 1 | 1 | 2 | 0 |

* The halbeard can be used with the axe head for a damage bonus and the hammer head for an attack bonus.
* Note that shields count also as weapons. All their points go into the **defense** attribute, but attacking with them is still possible.

## Armour

An unarmoured character has a base **armour class** of 10. This is the threshold for an attack skill check to hit.
If a character has a shield or a weapon with a **defense** attribute, this value is added to the characters **armour class**.

Armour can be classified into two categories, each worn item of an armour increasing the characters **armour class** by the given **defense** value. 

| Category | Materials | Def | Examples |
|----------|-----------|-----|----------|
| light/soft | fabric, leather | 1 | gloves, jacket, boots |
| heavy/hard | metal | 2 | cuirass, helmet |
| energy based | technology or magic | 3 | shield generator, spell |
